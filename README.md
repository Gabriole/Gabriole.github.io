## üöÄ Introduction

The **BMI Calculator** is a Python command-line and web application that computes a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height inputs. The calculator classifies users into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, allowing them to better understand their health metrics.
